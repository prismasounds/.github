# Prisma Sounds  

We create virtual instruments for musicians and producers. We think music is made of huge orchestras as much as it is made of old budget drum machines, that one instrument a busker built on his own and a bunch of pieces of junk hit together, and that's what we want the composers to have access to.
Discover them all on our website: [prismasounds.github.io](https://prismasounds.github.io/)
